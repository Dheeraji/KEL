Hi everyone, 

I know some of you are curious on how to use R markdown... So, here I a giving you a basic markdown code in R rather than just the output which are those nice .html documents

Below is what R markdown gives you every time you open a new markdown document...
You may be asking... how do I open and create an R markdown in the first place? Well.... go up to File>New File>R Markdown. You'll see it a couple options below your regular R script.  I typically pick the output as an .html.

# Overview of Markdown 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r iris}
summary(iris)
str(iris)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r iris, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(iris)+
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) + #insert important and intellectual comment here
  theme_bw()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Commenting 

You can have a bunch of text outside your code chunks, but you can still leave notes to yourself using the old-fashioned comment

## Headers...

Note that when you use "#" outside of code chunks those can be used to create different levels of headers...

## Header
### Header
#### Header
##### Etc... 

## Emphasis

**Look at that**

*Or this*

## Notes

## Are you tabbin kidding me? {.tabset}

### This

Fill in with your dreams

### Is 

Or your research

### Crazy

What ever you please 

## {-}

# Biomass Example

```{r}

```


## Data Exploration {.tabset}

### Data Structure

### Make a table
